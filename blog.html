    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
            After long three years, we are thrilled announce <b>experimental support for Java 17!</b>
            Long-awaited support for annotations on data types is here too!
            We are also dropping support for Java 1.6, Groovy 2.x, old Grails 2.x plugin and Hudson plugin.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            On top of this, OpenClover source code went through huge amount of technical changes, the
            biggest one was migration from Ant to Java. We hope this will make it much easier for you to
            contribute to the project.

            What's next on the roadmap?
            <ul>
                <li><b>4.6.0 "languages"</b> - full support for Java 17 (maybe also 21); support for Groovy 3.x and 4.x (maybe also 5.x)</li>
                <li><b>4.7.0 "eclidea"</b> - compatibility with the latest Eclipse and IDEA versions; upgrades for Gradle plugin</li>
                <li><b>4.8.0 "polyglot"</b> - we will explore support for Kotlin, Scala and other JVM languages</li>

    <h2 class="blog-post-title">OpenClover road map - look into the future</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>
                I quite often get questions like "When are you going to deliver feature X or fix bug Y".
                For this reason I'd like to share my thoughts on how I see development of OpenClover in
                near future and give you insight what to expect.
            </p>

            <p>
                We try to group features and bug-fixes from similar areas of functionality into themes and
                produce theme-focused releases. Let me share what are the themes of next releases and why:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>4.5.0 "Dev speed"</b> <br/>Because of the fact that
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket">Bitbucket terminates
                    support for Mercurial</a> and OpenClover uses it, we will migrate to Git (issue #98). We think it's quite
                    beneficial as Git is an industry standard. Repositories
                    will be migrated to GitHub, as this is more popular platform for open-source. We will also replace
                    Ant with Maven (Gradle is quickly gaining in popularity, so this is also an option) and drop
                    support for old plugins (Grails 2.x and Hudson) and Java versions (1.6 and older).
                    We are convinced that all these actions will lower the entry barrier for contributors and will make development
                    faster.</li>

                <li><b>4.6.0 "Languages"</b> <br/>There is a number of open bugs for both Groovy and Java, such as
                    adding support for @CompileStatic for Groovy (issue #31), type annotations for Java 8
                    (issue #20) or instrumentation of specific method references, like array constructors
                    (issue #59 and #95). Without fixing these it's pretty painful to exclude source files
                    one-by-one because of failing OpenClover.
                </li>

                <li><b>4.7.0 "Eclipse and IDEA"</b> <br/>We want to add support for the latest versions of Eclipse and
                    IntelliJ IDEA, as due to API evolution in these IDEs, OpenClover plugins are no longer fully
                    compatible. By the latest we mean versions from 2020.</li>

                <li><b>4.8.0 "Java 11"</b> <br/>Java 11 popularity is growing fast, so we no longer can ignore it. In
                    this release we add support for both Java 10 and Java 11 in one shot.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                You may ask why this order? We cannot postpone migration (4.5.0) as repositories will be deleted.
                Having an instrument-able and compile-able code (4.6.0) is more urgent than having smooth work
                in IDEs (4.7.0), because in the latter case you can always fallback to building from a command line
                (Ant / Maven / ...). And Java 11 (4.8.0) has to wait a bit, unfortunately, but it shall benefit
                from grammar fixes planned (4.6.0).

    <h2 class="blog-post-title">OpenClover 4.3.1 has been released!</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">

            <p>In this release we fixed a <a href="https://github.com/openclover/clover/issues/72">blocker bug</a>
                introduced in version 4.3.0. Feel free to upgrade to 4.3.1 to have your Java 9 projects with OpenClover</p>

            <p>What went wrong? Well, I extended the ANTLR grammar to handle module-info.java files, but the semantic
                rules created by me caused that tokens like "requires", "uses", "to" etc became keywords,
                causing that it was impossible to use them as normal identifiers (variable name, method name etc).
                I tested regular java files and module-info files separately, thus it slipped through my testing process.
                Few tricks with syntactic predicates and lookahead into the token stream fixed the problem :).</p>

                <b>2018.08.20 update</b>: Due to blockers <a href="https://github.com/openclover/clover/issues/72">#72</a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/openclover/clover/issues/75">#75</a> please hold on with upgrading to 4.3.0.
                I'm sorry for the trouble :-(. A first blocker is solved (on 'master' branch), I'm working on the second one.
                Both fixes will be delivered in 4.3.1.
            </div>

            <p>We are proud to share with you new feature release of OpenClover. Version 4.3.0 brings support for Java 9.</p>

            <p><b>Java 9 support</b></p>

            <p>With OpenClover 4.3.0 you can compile and run your projects using Java 9.</p>

            <p>You can use the "Java 9" source level setting in OpenClover command line tools,
                Ant or Maven as well as in your Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA projects. OpenClover core can also detect use of JDK9
                and apply this language level automatically, if not set. The Java grammar parser has been extended
                and can parse <i>module-info.java</i> files - there is no need to exclude these files from instrumentation.
            </p>

            <p><b>IntelliJ IDEA 13 is no longer supported</b></p>

            <p>As announced few months ago, we had to use APIs from IDEA 14 in order to implement JDK9 support,
                so OpenClover will no longer run in IDEA 13. As compensation, we added to the road map a
                support for IDEA 2017 and 2018.</p>

            <p><b>Ant &lt;clover-env&gt; task has been removed</b></p>

            <p>This Ant task was modifying configuration of the system classloader, so it was not the best design
                for the Java 9+ modular world. Taking into account that it was only injecting high-level Ant targets,
                which were useful for tiny projects or tutorials rather than production projects, we decided to
                drop this task. Instead of using the predefined high-level Ant targets (e.g. "with.clover"
                or "clover.report") we strongly recommend to configure appropriate Ant tasks (e.g. &lt;clover-setup&gt;
                or &lt;clover-report&gt;) in build files.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-title">OpenClover platform deprecation announcements</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">

            <p><b>Java 9 and 10 are coming \o/</b></p>
            <p>We are moving forward with development of support for Java 9 and Java 10 by OpenClover. They will be
                supported in next major OpenClover release, which is 4.3.0 scheduled for June 2018.</p>

            <p><b>End of support for old platforms is coming</b></p>
            <p>As we want to modernize and simplify code base as well as simplify testing, we would like to drop
                support for some of the old tools. We will do it gradually till end of the 2018 calendar year,
                together with next major OpenClover releases. We want to give you heads-up so that you won't be
                surprised and explain the reasons.</p>

            <p><b>Java 1.3-1.5 source level</b></p>

            <p>OpenClover requires JDK6 or higher for compilation and runtime. However, it was possible to set 1.3-1.5
                source level for instrumentation. We will remove support for these values, so the minimum level required
                will be 1.6. As Java language is backward-compatible you shall notice no impact. The only thing which
                breaks is using 'assert' keyword as variable name (which was possible in 1.3).</p>

            <p><b>Eclipse 4.2 and 4.3</b></p>

            <p>Eclipse 4.2 was released in 2012 and 4.3 in 2013, so long time ago. We believe that being able to run
                OpenClover with Eclipse 4.4 (Luna), which was released in 2014 is more than enough, especially that
                this version has integrated Java 8 support.</p>

            <p><b>IntelliJ IDEA 13</b></p>

            <p>Similarly, we're dropping support for IDEA 13, released in 2013. Another reason is that we need
            IDEA 14 APIs to support Java 9.</p>

            <p><b>Groovy 1.6-1.9</b></p>

            <p>The oldest Groovy version supported will be 2.0.0, released in 2012. We are doing this, because we want
                to get rid of an old ASM library - we must currently handle both ASM3 and ASM4 with various hacks
                (as they're binary incompatible).</p>

            <p><b>Grails 2.0-2.1</b></p>

            <p>As Grails uses Groovy, the oldest Grails version supported will be 2.2.x (<a
                    href="https://objectpartners.com/2015/05/14/list-of-groovy-versions-for-each-version-of-grails/">which
                is based on Groovy 2.0.x</a>). So, you will be able to continue using OpenClover with Grails 2.2-2.5.
                Note that we don't have dedicated support for Grails 3.x yet - it depends on the Gradle plugin.

            <p><b>Maven 2</b></p>

            <p>In OpenClover 4.2.1 we restored support for Maven 2.x (which was broken by a bug). However, the last
                Maven 2.2.1 release was published in November 2009 and it's
                <a href="https://maven.apache.org/maven-2.x-eol.html">end of life for long time</a>.
                Therefore, we believe it's the high time to drop support for it in OpenClover, especially that this will
                help us refresh clover-maven-plugin code.</p>

            <p><b>Java 6 (under consideration)</b></p>

            <p>We are not dropping support for Java 6 yet. However, Java 10 is already available, which is 4 major
                releases ahead and Java 6 is no longer supported by Oracle. Furthermore, the "1.6" source/target level
                has been marked as deprecated in Java 9, so it may be removed from javac at any time.
                According to various reports, e.g. from <a href="https://plumbr.io/blog/java/java-version-and-vendor-data-analyzed-2017-edition">Plumbr</a>,
                Java 6 usage dropped below 5% in 2017 and the trend continues. It's even impossible to install
                Java 6 SDK on the latest MacOS. Therefore, as soon as we will be forced to (removal of 1.6 from javac),
                we will drop Java 6 from OpenClover - probably together with introduction of Java 11 support.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Jenkins Clover Plugin 4.9.0 has been released</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>In this release we focused on solving bugs related with Pipeline builds and remote agents.</p>

            <p>We fixed <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-45981">JENKINS-45981</a>,
                <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-33610">JENKINS-33610</a> and
                <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34439">JENKINS-34439</a> bugs.</p>

            <p>We also solved the problem of automatic Clover integration not running on Windows and later Jenkins
            versions. Integration is now also smarter and does not attempt to integrate with non-Ant tasks.</p>

            <p>In addition to this we bumped minimum Jenkins version required to run the plugin.
                You have to use Jenkins <b>1.642.3</b> or higher. Note that this is the minimum version required
                by the Workflow Plugin 2.0 (aka the Pipelines Plugin).</p>

            <p>But we also did not forget to give something to please your eyes :) The 'OpenClover coverage summary'
            page has better look-and-feel of tables now.</p>

        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p><b>We have documentation!</b></p>

            <p>We are happy to announce that we have prepared end-user and developer documentation on
                our website. You can enjoy quick start guides, tutorials, plugin-specific guides,
                knowledge base articles and many many more. <u>It's over 300 pages in total!</u>
                And this is not a simple copy-and-paste - all code snippets, URLs, Maven artifact IDs
                etc have been updated to OpenClover. You will no longer have to jump back and forth
                between openclover.org and confluence.atlassian.com sites and wonder what is different
                between Clover and OpenClover.</p>

            <p><b>We have new plugin for SBT</b></p>

            <p>Thanks to one volunteer, OpenClover has a second plugin for SBT:
                <a href="https://github.com/barkhorn/sbt-clover">https://github.com/barkhorn/sbt-clover</a>.
                This plugin supports newer SBT versions, links with OpenClover and SBT's internal tasks
                (test in Test, compile in Compile) are used for the build, rather than a custom scope.
            </p>

            <p><b>OpenClover goes to the Hackengarten</b></p>

            <p>On 18th of October, our project team member, Grzegorz Lewandowski, went to Hackengarten
            organized by Tricity Java User Group and presented OpenClover. The feedback was very positive
            and we found 5 volunteers willing to hack and code for us! Unfortunately they did not
            deliver any feature yet, as most of the time was spent on setting up development environment
            (it's a lesson for us to be better prepared and to simplify our build processes) and explaining
            OpenClover details. Nevertheless, the Hackengarten is a cyclic event, so stay tuned! In case
            you happen to be in Gdańsk, Poland and would like to join our forces, please watch the
            <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Trojmiasto-Java-User-Group">https://www.meetup.com/Trojmiasto-Java-User-Group</a>
            for new meetings.</p>

            <p><b>New 4.2.1 release is coming soon</b></p>

            <p>This will be a bug-fix release in which we solve compatibility issues with Maven 2.x.
                It has also fixes for automatic Ant and Maven integrators, required for CI systems,
                such as Jenkins or Bamboo. More details on
                <a href="https://github.com/openclover/clover/issues">https://github.com/openclover/clover/issues</a> </p>

            <p><b>What's next?</b></p>

            <p>As I wrote in my previous blog post, we want to focus on Gradle and Jenkins plugins. I am also
            working on better support for OpenClover in Bamboo - so that it will be possible to use automatic
                integration feature.</p>

                We are happy to announce that our first release of OpenClover is out. It is based on the
                open-sourced code of Atlassian Clover 4.1.2. Kudos for Atlassian for open-sourcing it!
                You can download OpenClover Core as well as integrations for Ant, Maven, Grails, Eclipse,

            <p><b>We're looking for contributors for Gradle Plugin</b><br/>
            Unfortunately the Gradle Plugin for OpenClover is not ready yet. We decided to postpone it because does not handle multi-module projects, which we believe is a very common setup.
            In case you feel confident with writing plugins for Gradle and would like to help us, your contribution will be more than welcome!
            </p>

            <p><b>What's next?</b><br/>
            In the incoming months we're going to:
            <ul>
                <li>release the Gradle Plugin</li>

    <h2 class="blog-post-title">Welcome to OpenClover</h2>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>
                In April 2017 Atlassian&reg; decided to publish sources of Clover - the most sophisticated code coverage
                tool for Java and Groovy. Clover has been commercially developed for nearly fifteen years (first by
                Cenqua, next by Atlassian), so literally <b>thousands of man hours</b> were spent on making it so <a href="features">rich in
                features</a>. Clover's source base is about 10 times larger than second best coverage tool - JaCoCo.
                I must admit that I had a pleasure to be one of its developers for five years.
                Thus, as you can notice, making Clover completely free and open source is an amazing gift from Atlassian
                to the open source community. Great kudos for Atlassian!
            </p>

            <p>
                Clover is not only rich in features, but also unique compared to other code coverage tools (such as
                JaCoCo or
                Cobertura), because it's based on the source code instrumentation (and not the bytecode
                instrumentation).
                While this approach has some limitations (you need to recompile the code, for instance) it gives huge benefits,
                for instance:
            <ul>
                <li>as Clover "knows" the code structure it can measure 20+ code metrics</li>
                <li>it can recognize language- or framework-specific code constructs</li>
                <li>it is more "transparent" to other bytecode manipulating tools</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been working on Clover since 2012 and I dare to say that several recent major releases of Clover
                (such as version 3.2 with Java 8, version 3.3 with parameterised JUnit4 and Spock tests or version 4.0
                with
                overhauled HTML report) came out of my hands. I had the opportunity to do everything - from technical
                support
                to being developer lead and planning a road map. I know the product inside out and I really love it -
                from both
                end-user and a programmer perspective (the code is really solid piece of work). So at the moment
                I heard about the idea of
                open-sourcing it,
                I immediately knew that I want to participate in this "new life" of Clover.
            </p>

            <p>
                So here we are: a new home page you're reading right now is set up, all sources are available for
                download from Bitbucket, I am working on a binary release of OpenClover 4.2,
                which should be ready quite soon. I am eager to share my expertize and to coordinate the entire open
                source
                project.
            </p>

            <p>You may ask: <b>What can I do?</b></p>

            <p>My answer is: <b>Just start using it!</b> I am certain that you'll love it! Spread the word, ask
                questions,
                provide answers on Q&amp;A forums like Atlassian Answers or Stackoverflow. Migrate your builds from
                Clover 4.1
                (or older) to OpenClover 4.2 as soon as it becomes available.</p>

            <p>The bigger user base, the bigger active Clover community, the bigger chance to find new volunteers to
                contribute to
                Clover. And last but not least the bigger motivation for me :-) to drive the whole project.</p>

            <p>Or maybe you would like to contribute? If yes, then jump to the
                <a href="doc/manual/4.2.0/developer-guide.html">Clover Development
                    Hub</a>
                for build instructions, clone the repository and grab
                <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/projects/CLOV">some bug or feature request</a> for implementation.</p>
