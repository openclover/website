                <h3 id="AboutCodeCoverage-WhatisCodeCoverage?">What is Code Coverage?</h3>
                <p><em>Code coverage</em> is the percentage of code which is covered by automated tests. <em>Code
                    coverage measurement</em> simply determines which statements in a body of code have been executed
                    through a test run, and which statements have not. In general, a code coverage system collects
                    information about the running program and then combines that with source information to generate a
                    report on the test suite's code coverage.</p>
                <p>Code coverage is part of a feedback loop in the development process. As tests are developed, code
                    coverage highlights aspects of the code which may not be adequately tested and which require
                    additional testing. This loop will continue until coverage meets some specified target.</p>
                <h3 id="AboutCodeCoverage-WhyMeasureCodeCoverage?">Why Measure Code Coverage?</h3>
                <p>It is well understood that unit testing improves the quality and predictability of your software
                    releases. Do you know, however, how well your unit tests actually test your code? How many tests are
                    enough? Do you need more tests? These are the questions code coverage measurement seeks to
                    answer.</p>
                <p>Coverage measurement also helps to avoid test entropy. As your code goes through multiple release
                    cycles, there can be a tendency for unit tests to atrophy. As new code is added, it may not meet the
                    same testing standards you put in place when the project was first released. Measuring code coverage
                    can keep your testing up to the standards you require. You can be confident that when you go into
                    production there will be minimal problems because you know the code not only passes its tests but
                    that it is well tested.</p>
                <p>In summary, we measure code coverage for the following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To know how well our tests actually test our code</li>
                    <li>To know whether we have enough testing in place</li>
                    <li>To maintain the test quality over the lifecycle of a project</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Code coverage is not a panacea. Coverage generally follows an 80-20 rule. Increasing coverage values
                    becomes difficult, with new tests delivering less and less incrementally. If you follow defensive
                    programming principles, where failure conditions are often checked at many levels in your software,
                    some code can be very difficult to reach with practical levels of testing. Coverage measurement is
                    not a replacement for good code review and good programming practices.</p>
                <p>In general you should adopt a sensible coverage target and aim for even coverage across all of the
                    modules that make up your code. Relying on a single overall coverage figure can hide large gaps in
                    coverage.</p>
                <h3 id="AboutCodeCoverage-HowCodeCoverageWorks">How Code Coverage Works</h3>
                <p>There are many approaches to code coverage measurement. Broadly there are three approaches, which may
                    be used in combination:</p>
                <div class="table-wrap">
                    <table class="confluenceTable">
                        <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Source code instrumentation</strong></p></td>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p>This approach adds instrumentation statements to the source code
                                and compiles the code with the normal compile tool chain to produce an instrumented
                                assembly.</p></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Intermediate code instrumentation</strong></p></td>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p>Here the compiled class files are instrumented by adding new
                                bytecodes, and a new instrumented class is generated.</p></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Runtime information collection</strong></p></td>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p>This approach collects information from the runtime environment
                                as the code executes to determine coverage information</p></td>
                        </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
                <p>Clover uses source code instrumentation, because although it requires developers to perform an
                    instrumented build, source code instrumentation produces the most accurate coverage measurement for
                    the least runtime performance overhead.</p>
                <p>Be aware that while Clover is capable of instrumenting both Java and Groovy source code, the
                    instrumentation stage occurs prior to compilation with Java and during compilation with Groovy.</p>
                <p>As the code under test executes, code coverage systems collect information about which statements
                    have been executed. This information is then used as the basis of reports. In addition to these
                    basic mechanisms, coverage approaches vary on what forms of coverage information they collect. There
                    are many forms of coverage beyond basic statement coverage including conditional coverage, method
                    entry and path coverage.</p>
                <h3 id="AboutCodeCoverage-CodeCoveragewithClover">Code Coverage with Clover</h3>
                <p>Clover is designed to measure code coverage in a way that fits seamlessly with your current
                    development environment and practices, whatever they may be. Clover's IDE Plugins provide developers
                    with a way to quickly measure code coverage without having to leave the IDE. Clover's Ant and Maven
                    integrations allow coverage measurement to be performed in Automated Build and Continuous
                    Integration systems, and reports generated to be shared by the team.</p><h4
                    id="AboutCodeCoverage-TypesofCoveragemeasured">Types of Coverage measured</h4>
                <p>Clover measures three basic types of coverage analysis:</p>
                <div class="table-wrap">
                    <table class="confluenceTable">
                        <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Statement</strong></p></td>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p>Statement coverage measures whether each statement is
                                executed.</p></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Branch</strong></p></td>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p>Branch coverage (sometimes called Decision Coverage) measures
                                which possible branches in flow control structures are followed. Clover does this by
                                recording if the boolean expression in the control structure evaluated to both true and
                                false during execution.<br class="atl-forced-newline"/> <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
                                In Groovy code, Clover also treats Elvis expressions (a :? b), safe method calls
                                (a?.b()), safe property calls (a?.b) and safe attribute calls (a?.@b) as branches.</p>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p><strong>Method</strong></p></td>
                            <td class="confluenceTd"><p>Method coverage measures if a method was entered at all during
                                execution.</p></td>
                        </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>
                </div>
                <p>Clover uses these measurements to produce a Total Coverage Percentage for each class, file, package
                    and for the project as a whole. The Total Coverage Percentage allows entities to be ranked in
                    reports. The Total Coverage Percentage (TPC) is calculated as follows:</p>
                <div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;">
                    <div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="syntaxhighlighter-pre" data-syntaxhighlighter-params="brush: java; gutter: false; theme: Confluence"
     data-theme="Confluence">TPC = (BT + BF + SC + MC)/(2*B + S + M) * 100%

where

BT - branches that evaluated to &quot;true&quot; at least once
BF - branches that evaluated to &quot;false&quot; at least once
SC - statements covered
MC - methods entered

B - total number of branches
S - total number of statements
M - total number of methods
</pre>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <h4 id="AboutCodeCoverage-WhataboutLineCoveragemetric?">What about Line Coverage metric?</h4>
                <p>A <em>Line Coverage</em> metric is a basic metric offered by bytecode instrumentation tools, such as
                    Cobertura or Emma, and it's tightly related with a fact that inside compiled classes we can have
                    only information about line numbers (instead of information about code elements, such as statements
                    etc).</p>
                <p>As Clover uses source code instrumentation, it actually &quot;sees&quot; a real code structure.
                    Therefore, Clover offers a <em>Statement Coverage</em> metric, which is similar to a Line Coverage
                    metric in terms of it's granularity and precision.</p>
