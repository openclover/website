            Coverage Recorders </h1>


        <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
            You are reading documentation for version 4.2.x. Check the <a href="../latest/ant--coverage-recorders.html" class="alert-link">latest version</a>.

        <div id="content" class="view">

            <div id="main-content">
                <p>This page explains few details how Clover code instrumentation works and how the coverage data is
                    being collected at runtime.</p>
                <p>This article might be helpful for you in case you have significant performance problems or your
                    application runs in a restricted environment.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <h2>Instrumenting code</h2>
                <p>Every time Clover instruments the code (via &lt;clover-instr/&gt; or &lt;clover-setup/&gt; - both
                    Java and Groovy) it records information about the code structure (packages, files, classes, method,
                    statements, branches, test methods etc) into the Clover database. Because of fact that the same
                    database can be used multiple times (for instance in case of incremental compilation; or when
                    project has several modules compiled separately), it maintains history of changes in blocks named
                    'instrumentation session'.</p>
                <p>Every instrumented class is enhanced by adding code which requests a Clover's coverage recorder
                    instance. Such coverage recorder getter is called with some arguments, which allows to determine
                    which Clover database file and which instrumentation session in this file contains information about
                    the class structure (like indexes of statements, methods, branches etc).</p>
                <p>As project contains many classes, Clover has an optimization so that some of these classes will share
                    the same coverage recorder instance - exact strategy depends on selected recorder type - see
                    below.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p><em>Diagram: code instrumentation process</em></p>
                <p><em>Information about code structured is stored in Clover database. Every instrumented class contains
                    information about database (initstring) and the instrumentation session time stamp. Thanks to this
                    it's possible to map compiled class file to a corresponding source file (also in correct version -
                    see C.java).<br/></em></p>

                <h2>Executing code</h2>
                <h3>Fixed Coverage Recorder</h3>
                <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <p>This is a default coverage recorder and we
                        strongly recommend using it. </p>
</div>
                <p>It's using an in-memory fixed-size <em><strong>long[]</strong></em> array for recording hit counts
                    for methods, statements and branches. Calculation of the long[] array size requires access to the
                    Clover Database (clover.db) at runtime, however. All classes which were compiled in the same
                    instrumentation session (i.e. within the same &lt;clover-instr&gt; or javac or groovyc call) will
                    share the same instance of the coverage recorder.</p>
                <p><span><img src="attachments/321855703/321982148.png"


                ></span>
                </p>
                <h3>Growable Coverage Recorder</h3>
                <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <p>This recorder simplifies a deployment and test
                        process as clover.db is not required at runtime. It's useful for cases like in-container tests,
                        tests executed on application server, builds on remote agents or for Android applications.</p>
</div>
                <p>It's using a dynamically resizeable two-dimensional <em><strong>long[][1000000]</strong></em> array
                    for recording hit counts for methods. Thanks to this it does not require access to the Clover
                    Database at runtime and this is its main advantage. It's performance is slightly lower than the
                    Fixed Coverage Recorder due to memory allocation and two-level indexing. All classes which were
                    compiled in the same instrumentation session (i.e. within the same &lt;clover-instr&gt; or javac or
                    groovyc call) will share the same instance of the coverage recorder.</p>

                ></span>
                </p>
                <h3>Shared Coverage Recorder</h3>
                <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <div><p>Use this coverage recorder only in case when:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>you have a large Grails project with hundreds of Domain Classes or Services
                                <strong>and</strong></li>
                            <li>you instrument and run test classes <strong>and</strong></li>
                            <li>you have a significant performance problem related with coverage data writing and/or
                                generating Clover reports
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
</div>
                <p> </p>
                <p>It's a modification of the Growable Coverage Recorder designed specially for Grails-based projects.
                    It shares the same coverage recorder instance for every instrumented class which was compiled with
                    the same database initstring and configuration settings (like flush policy). It means that it
                    ignores instrumentation session timestamps.</p>
                <p>Grails build system works in such way that it compiles every domain class and service class
                    separately. As a consequence, Clover &quot;sees&quot; this as a separate instrumentation session. It
                    means that in case of the fixed or growable coverage recorder it creates a separate instance of the
                    recorder for every domain or service class.</p>
                <p>It might become a performance problem if you have many such classes <strong>and</strong> you execute
                    test methods, because end of <em><strong>every</strong> </em>test method will force creation of the
                    per-test coverage file (<em>clover.db*.s</em>) from <em><strong>all</strong> </em>coverage recorder
                    instances. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>500 domain classes * 1000 unit tests = 500 coverage recorders * 1000 snapshots = 500'000 files
                        on disk <img class="emoticon emoticon-warning" src="images/icons/emoticons/warning.png" data-emoticon-name="warning" alt="(warning)"/>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that the performance problem does not occur during normal application run or when test code is
                    not instrumented. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>500 domain classes (normal app execution) = 500 coverage recorders * 1-2 snapshots (depends on
                        flush policy) = 500-1000 files on disk
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> </p>
                <p>If you decide to use a Shared Coverage Recorder, you must keep in mind that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>you <em><strong>cannot</strong> </em>have multiple modules which have the same initstring value,
                        but they actually point to different files (it's a typical case if you have a multi-module Maven
                        project and you use the same relative initstring for each module)
                        <ul>
                            <li>TIP: use an absolute path for initstrings or share a same database among modules</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>you <em><strong>cannot</strong> </em>deploy outdated class files, for which information in the
                        Clover database is not longer valid (as instrumentation timestamp is ignored); <br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li>TIP: perform a full project build, deleting all old classes as well as Clover database
                                and coverage recording files (see <a href="grails--advanced-setup-configuration.html">&quot;Using
                                    shared coverage recorder&quot;</a> example for Grails)
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
