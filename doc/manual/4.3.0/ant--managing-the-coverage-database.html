                <h3>Database structure and lifecycle</h3>
                <p>The Clover database consists of several files that are constructed at various stages of the
                    instrumentation and coverage recording process. The following files are created if Clover is
                    initialized with an <code>initstring</code> of &quot;clover.db&quot;</p><h4 id="ManagingtheCoverageDatabase-Registryfile">Registry file</h4>
                <p><strong>Filename:</strong> <code>clover.db</code></p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Registry file contains information about all of the classes that
                    have been instrumented by Clover. This file does not contain any actual coverage recording data.</p>
                <p><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> The Registry file is <strong>written</strong> during the instrumentation
                    process. If an existing Registry file is found, the existing file is updated. If no Registry file is
                    found, a new Registry file is created. The Registry file is <strong>read</strong> by
                    Clover-instrumented code when it is executed, and also during report generation or coverage browsing
                    (such as via an IDE plugin or the Swing Viewer).</p><h4 id="ManagingtheCoverageDatabase-CoverageRecordingFiles">CoverageRecording Files</h4>
                <p><strong>Filename:</strong> <code>clover.dbHHHHHHH_TTTTTTTTTT</code> or <code>clover.dbHHHHHHH_TTTTTTTTTT.1</code>
                    (where HHHHHHH and TTTTTTTTTT are both hex strings)</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> CoverageRecording files contain actual coverage data. When running
                    instrumented code, Clover creates one or more Coverage Recorders. Each Coverage Recorder will write
                    one CoverageRecording file. The number of Coverage Recorders created at runtime depends the nature
                    of the application you are Clovering. In general a new Coverage Recorder will be created for each
                    new ClassLoader instance that loads a Clovered class file. The first hex number in the filename
                    (HHHHHHH) is a unique number based on the recording context. The second hex number (TTTTTTTTTT) is
                    the timestamp (ms since epoch) of the creation of the Clover Recorder. CoverageRecording files are
                    named this way to try to minimize the chance of a name clash. While it is theoretically possible
                    that a name clash could occur, in practice the chances are very small.</p>
                <p><strong>Lifecycle:</strong> CoverageRecording files are <strong>written</strong> during the execution
                    of Clover-instrumented code. CoverageRecording files are <strong>read</strong> during report
                    generation or coverage browsing.</p>
                <div><p class="title">Note</p>
                    <span></span>
                    <div><p>Clover has a failsafe mechanism for writing
                        recording files to disk when using interval-based flush policies. The mechanism alternates
                        between writing to a primary recording file and a secondary recording file. This prevents data
                        loss in the event of abnormal JVM termination. The secondary recording file has the same name as
                        a normal recording file but with .1 appended to its name.</p></div>
                </div>
                <h3>Managing the Clover database</h3>
                <p>Because the Clover database can consist of many recording files, you might find it easier to create
                    the database in its own directory. This directory can be created at the start of a Clover build, and
                    deleted once coverage reports have been generated from the database.</p>
                <p>Although Clover will update an existing database over successive builds, it is in general recommended
                    that the database be deleted after it is used to generate reports, so that a fresh database is
                    created on the next build. <strong>Doing this improves the runtime performance of Clover.</strong>
                    The <code>&lt;<a href="ant--clover-clean.html">clover-clean</a>&gt;</code> Ant task is provided
                    to allow easy deletion of a Clover database. Note that the IDE Plugins all have a feature to
                    automatically manage the Clover database for you.</p>
