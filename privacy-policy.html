            <p>We use Google Search Console to offer you a possibility to search documentation. This utility
                allows us to collect anonymous statistics of the most frequently used queries and visited pages.
                We use it to improve website content and layout.</p>
            <p>Similarly, we use Apache's HTTP logs and a tool like Webalizer to collect statistics about
                top pages, visits, countries, web browsers used. All theses are aggregated data. We use it to
                optimise the website.</p>

                Eclipse, IDEA, AspectJ, Jenkins, Hudson) collect or send to us any data.</p>
            <p>Eclipse and IDEA plugins contain a feature to check if there are newer versions of the software
                available. This feature contacts openclover.org website. This is a simple HTTP call and no

            <p>You can contact us via email (support@openclover.org and contact@openclover.org). Emails are stored
                on a server hosted by <a href="https://blink.pl/polityka-prywatnosci/">H88 SA</a> company. The
                company is located in Poland, EU. Emails may be forwarded to mailbox of a project member handling the
                correspondence, however, also a generic one like gmail.com. We keep emails for no longer than one year
                (typically we delete them once a case is solved). We encourage you to not send any sensitive data,
                do not hesitate to anonymize it.</p>

            <p>You can create issues or comment on them in our issue tracker on github.com.
                These issues and comments are public for everyone. We do not delete them unless there is a significant
                reason to do so (e.g. spam, invalid information).</p>

            <p>You can make code contributions. <b>Please do treat commits and pull requests as irrevocable</b>.
                Once they are integrated into main codebase, they will not be removed from commit history.
                This is nature of Git version control system, in which a removal of a single commit would require rewriting
                entire repository history. Furthermore, for legal reasons we must know who is an author of the
                code (copyright law). Thus please ensure that commit author and email are set correctly in commits.
